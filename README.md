# Keycloak Theme Customization Guide

Welcome to the Keycloak Theme Customization Guide! If you're looking to customize the theme for your Keycloak application using the Keycloakify tool, you've come to the right place. Before you begin, let's understand how to organize your projects and select the appropriate branch for theme customization.

## Repository Structure

The repository follows a simple structure with a `main` branch for presentation purposes and separate branches for individual projects: `Aqviser` and `Perivallon`. Here's an overview:

1. **main**: The main branch contains only the README file for presentation purposes.

2. **Aqviser**: The Aqviser branch is dedicated to the Aqviser project's theme customization.

3. **Perivallon**: The Perivallon branch is dedicated to the Perivallon project's theme customization.

## Choosing the Branch

To customize the theme for your Keycloak application using Keycloakify, follow these steps to choose the appropriate branch:

1. **Identify Your Project**: Determine which project (Aqviser or Perivallon) you're customizing the theme for.

2. **Select the Corresponding Branch**: Choose the branch that corresponds to your project:

   - If you're customizing the theme for the Aqviser project, switch to the `Aqviser` branch.
   - If you're customizing the theme for the Perivallon project, switch to the `Perivallon` branch.

3. **Install Keycloakify**: Make sure you have Keycloakify installed in your environment. Keycloakify is a tool designed to simplify the process of customizing Keycloak themes.

4. **Customize the Theme**: With the appropriate branch selected and Keycloakify installed, you can now customize the theme files according to your requirements using Keycloakify's commands and configurations.
